Dimms the keyboard backlight depending on the surrounding light.

Works for MacBook Air (4,2) on Linux 3.1.0-rc9-00064-g65112dc.

Usage:

   # Run and adjust backlight depending on light sensor data
   ./kbsd 

   # Setup backlight value indepently (0-255)
   ./kbsd 128

Requirements:
   You need to have read access to the light sensor and write
   access to the led brightness file. See kbsd for details.
